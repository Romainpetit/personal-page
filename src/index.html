                    In my spare time, I like to experiment with new web tech and learn languages beyond my native french and sarcasm proficiency.</h2>

                    <p>Freelancing for 3 years, I’m mostly achieving nice projets with <a href="http://www.leadformance.com/en/" target="_blank">Leadformance</a>. They set up these store locators you find on <a href="http://www.leadformance.com/en/our-clients/" target="_blank">big retail brands</a> websites, and I helped with the front end for about 50 projects deliveries. Before that I’ve been a front-end developer at severals web agencies.</p>
